# Todo-List
Building a Simple To-Do List App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Ever wondered how to create a basic to-do list application using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? I’ve just completed this small project, and I’m excited to share it with you all! This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn the basics of web development and see how these three languages work together to create functional web applications



In this project, I focused on the following key aspects:

HTML: Structuring the content of the app.

CSS: Styling the app to make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Adding interactivity to allow users to add, delete, and manage their tasks.

The final result is a clean and simple interface that lets users manage their daily tasks efficiently.



Check out the code and feel free to try it out yourself! I’d love to hear your feedback or see any improvements you might suggest.
